# :dollar: Loan Risk Model Assessment 

## :checkered_flag: Overview
This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a machine learning model to *classify the risk associated with loan applications using logistic regression*. Utilizing a dataset of historical lending activity, the model seeks to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers, distinguishing between healthy loans and those at high risk of defaulting.

## :point_up: Instructions
The challenge involves several key steps: 
- Setting up a dedicated repository
- Preparing the data for modeling by splitting it into features and labels as well as training and testing sets
- Fitting a logistic regression model 
- Evaluating its performance through metrics like the confusion matrix and classification report

**Participants are tasked with analyzing the model's ability to predict both low-risk and high-risk loans accurately.**

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Evaluation Criteria
The project is graded based on the thoroughness of data preparation, the accuracy of the logistic regression model, the depth of analysis in the report, adherence to coding conventions and formatting, and the quality of code comments.

## :open_file_folder: Report Structure
The README.md file serves as the report, structured to include an analysis overview, detailed results highlighting accuracy, precision, and recall scores, and a summary with recommendations for the model's application or improvements.

**This challenge not only tests participants' skills in machine learning and logistic regression but also their ability to document and justify their analytical decisions comprehensively.**
